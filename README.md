# PixrelBatch

I tried a bunch of online image tools.

Every page was annoying.
Sign-ups. Limits. Watermarks. Subscriptions.

So I made my own.

PixelBatch runs **entirely in your browser**.
Nothing is uploaded. Nothing is tracked.

If your computer can do the work,
no website deserves to charge you for it.

## What it does

That’s it.

Nothing leaves your machine.

No uploads.
No analytics.
No bullshit.

MIT.

Fork it.
Change it.
Use it.

Just don’t turn it into a paywalled SaaS.
